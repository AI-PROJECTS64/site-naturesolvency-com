        Concept Note — working document (EN only, non-binding)
      </div>
      <h1>NatureSolvency.com — Concept Note</h1>
      <p class="muted">
        This note outlines a possible positioning for <b>NatureSolvency.com</b> as a
        <b>descriptive, neutral digital asset</b> dedicated to <b>nature-related financial risks</b>
        and what we call <b>“nature solvency”</b>. It is not a rating methodology, not a
        policy document and not a legal or investment opinion.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>1. Idea: from nature-related risks to “nature solvency”</h2>
      <p>
        Over the last few years, initiatives such as <b>TNFD</b> have helped financial
        institutions and corporates acknowledge that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a large share of economic activity depends on <b>ecosystem services</b>
            (water regulation, soil fertility, pollination, coastal protection, etc.),</li>
        <li>the degradation of nature can translate into <b>credit, market and operational risks</b>,</li>
        <li>nature loss can ultimately become a <b>solvency question</b> for certain
            business models, sectors or territories.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Nature solvency</b> is a way of framing this: how resilient are cash flows,
        assets and liabilities when ecosystem services are stressed, degraded or lost?
        <b>NatureSolvency.com</b> is proposed as a neutral banner for that question.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>2. Strategic context (2025–2035)</h2>
      <p>
        Between 2025 and 2035, several trends are likely to shape the space:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>More <b>mandatory disclosures</b> on nature-related risks and dependencies,</li>
        <li>integration of nature into <b>prudential frameworks</b>, stress tests and
            risk appetites,</li>
        <li>emergence of <b>data platforms</b> linking geospatial, ecological and
            financial information,</li>
        <li>pressure from supervisors, NGOs and investors to move beyond climate-only
            metrics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In that landscape, <b>NatureSolvency.com</b> can act as a <b>long-lived label</b>
        for frameworks, observatories, indices or platforms that connect
        <b>biodiversity, ecosystems and solvency</b> in a language understandable by boards,
        risk committees and regulators.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. Potential acquirers &amp; positioning</h2>
      <p>
        The domain is best suited to actors who need a <b>neutral, non-product-specific</b>
        banner:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>banks, insurers and large asset owners building <b>nature-risk strategies</b>,</li>
        <li>stock exchanges, index providers or data platforms working on <b>nature-related
            benchmarks</b>,</li>
        <li>multilateral, public–private or philanthropic initiatives on <b>nature and finance</b>,</li>
        <li>specialised climate–nature platforms expanding into <b>solvency and prudential</b> topics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The positioning should remain clearly <b>descriptive</b>: NatureSolvency.com is the
        banner, not the guarantee. The credibility comes from the governance and methodologies
        deployed behind it, not from the name alone.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>4. Illustrative use-cases (within clear boundaries)</h2>
      <h3>4.1 Possible directions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>“Nature Solvency Framework”</b> describing how nature-related risks feed
            into capital, provisions and business model resilience.</li>
        <li><b>Nature Solvency Observatory</b> monitoring sectoral or regional exposures,
            without providing individual issuer credit opinions.</li>
        <li><b>Scenario &amp; training hub</b> for nature-related stress tests, supporting
            prudential and internal risk work.</li>
        <li><b>Knowledge platform</b> aggregating methodologies, case studies and
            supervisory expectations on nature-related solvency risks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.2 Non-target uses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Presenting NatureSolvency.com as a <b>regulated credit rating agency</b>
            or official supervisory body (unless such status is formally obtained),</li>
        <li>marketing it as a <b>guarantee of solvency</b> or as an automatic “seal
            of safety” for specific products,</li>
        <li>using the brand to give the impression of <b>regulatory approval</b> where
            none exists.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>5. Legal, regulatory and reputational framing</h2>
      <p>
        Any initiative under <b>NatureSolvency.com</b> will have to coexist with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>prudential regulation for banks and insurers,</li>
        <li>securities, disclosure and listing rules,</li>
        <li>ESG and sustainability reporting requirements,</li>
        <li>nature-related regulations at national and regional level.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The domain name itself:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>does <b>not</b> confer any regulatory status or licence,</li>
        <li>does <b>not</b> replace formal credit ratings, internal models or supervisory
            assessments,</li>
        <li>is a <b>communication and framing asset</b>, which can support serious work
            but cannot substitute it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted foot">
        This document does not constitute legal, financial, supervisory or investment advice.
        It is an indicative, non-binding articulation of potential uses for the domain.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>6. Relation to the broader “Solvency” family</h2>
      <p>
        In some strategies, <b>NatureSolvency.com</b> could be combined with other
        thematic assets such as <b>WaterSolvency.com</b>, <b>EnergySolvency.com</b>
        and <b>ClimateSolvency.com</b> to build a broader <b>“Global Solvency Framework”</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea is not to merge all risks into a single score, but to provide a
        <b>coherent vocabulary</b> for boards and supervisors when discussing the
        solvency impact of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>water stress and hydrological risks,</li>
        <li>energy transition and energy-system shocks,</li>
        <li>climate-related physical and transition risks,</li>
        <li>nature and biodiversity loss.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        NatureSolvency.com is the <b>nature pillar</b> in that narrative: focused on
        ecosystems and biodiversity, not competing with existing climate-only frameworks
        but complementing them.
      </p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>7. Transaction &amp; contact</h2>
      <p>
        A potential transaction for <b>NatureSolvency.com</b> would typically follow:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>NDA and initial discussions about intended use, governance and safeguards,</li>
        <li>formal offer and agreement on price and transfer conditions,</li>
        <li>escrow process and transfer of the <b>NatureSolvency.com</b> domain name.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Only the domain name is transferred. No data, models, software, indices,
        methodologies, teams or advisory services are included by default.
      </p>
      <p class="muted foot">
        All future uses remain the sole responsibility of the acquirer and its
        governance, risk and compliance structures.
